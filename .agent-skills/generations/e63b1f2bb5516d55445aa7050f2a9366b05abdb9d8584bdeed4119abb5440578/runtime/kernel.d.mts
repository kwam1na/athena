 *      collapse to one line, details are redacted and bounded, and a blocker
 *      without remediation guidance is unconstructible. A call site cannot opt
 *      out of any of it, which is the whole reason there is one constructor.
 *   2. `GATE_STRUCTURAL_FINDING_CODES` — the evaluator's own blocked-finding
 *      codes, disjoint from the provider code surfaces configs declare. The
 *      config loader partitions each obligation's `waivableCodes ⊎
 *      nonWaivableCodes` against this constant plus config data; the gate
 *      evaluator emits them.
 *   3. `renderBlockers` / `serializeBlockers` — the two faces of the one
 *      renderer. Both neutralize per spec §11.2 and both are **total**: they
 *      never throw, whatever the blocker carries. This matters because they run
 *      inside failure handlers, where a throw destroys the very output the
 *      contract exists to produce.
 *
 * WHERE EACH CHAIN LIVES, AND WHY IT IS SPLIT.
 *
 *   Redaction runs in the **constructor** (spec §11.3). Stored, serialized, and
 *   logged forms all descend from the constructed value, so redacting later
 *   would leave the secret in every retained copy.
 *
 *   Neutralization runs in the **renderer** (spec §11.2). The renderer is the
 *   last thing before a display surface, and not everything it renders passed
 *   through the constructor — an MCP payload deserialized from another process
 *   is exactly the case a constructor-side guard would miss.
 *
 * PURITY. This module is on the d1 kernel-import allowlist: pure modules import
 * it, so it must acquire no dependencies. It imports nothing at all — no fs, no
 * process, no clock, no runtime API. The import-boundary sensor enforces this.

 * The harness configuration: one object, injected everywhere, validated once.

 * by name. `defineHarnessConfig` is the one door into that object.
 *
 * WHY THE INVARIANTS LIVE HERE. A config is policy, and inconsistent policy is
 * not a runtime surprise to be discovered at the gate — it is a defect the
 * author should learn about while editing the file. So the rules that relate one
 * member to another (a waiver flag that contradicts the resolution kinds it
 * governs, a delivery-record path the identity rules would exclude from one set
 * but not the other, a finding code no obligation classifies) are checked at
 * load time, all of them, and reported together. Reporting the first failure
 * only would turn one editing session into five.
 *
 * WHY THE CODE UNIVERSE IS INJECTED. The partition invariant needs to know every
 * finding code an obligation can emit. That universe is the structural registry
 * from the blocker contract plus the finding codes the config's own providers
 * declare — both available here. It is deliberately *not* obtained by importing
 * the validator or the evaluator: the loader must not depend on the modules
 * whose vocabulary it is checking, or the check becomes circular and the
 * validator becomes unable to change without the loader agreeing.
 *
 * PURITY. This module is on the kernel-import allowlist that pure modules draw
 * from, so it must stay pure itself: it imports the blocker contract and nothing
 * else — no filesystem, no process, no clock. Reading a config file from disk is
 * the job of the command surfaces; what happens here is validation of a value
 * that has already been handed over.
 *

/**
 * Who is running the gate, and what that entitles them to.
 *
 * THE LADDER IS ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE. Four rungs, in strictly descending
 * order of what they may do:
 *
 *   ci     — repository-authorized automation. May carry a delegated
 *            obligation, because a declared policy says which job answers for
 *            it and the environment corroborates that the job is the one
 *            running. It may not waive: nobody is present to accept anything.
 *   agent  — a recognized coding agent. May satisfy an obligation with
 *            evidence, and may never waive one. An agent that could waive
 *            could waive its own review.
 *   human  — an interactive person, both streams on a terminal. The only rung
 *            the waiver door opens for, and only for the codes the config
 *            classifies as waivable.
 *   unknown— everything else. Satisfies nothing on its own.
 *
 * THE ENVIRONMENT IS A PARAMETER. This module never touches `process`. The
 * caller hands over a snapshot, which is what lets the whole gate be exercised
 * as a decision table and keeps the module inside the purity sensor's d1 class.
 *
 * A PARTIAL CI MATCH IS AN UNAUTHORIZED AUTOMATION, NEVER A DOWNGRADE. This is
 * the rule with the most ways to get subtly wrong, so it is stated once and
 * applied in every direction: if anything in the environment claims to be a
 * declared automation — the policy env key naming a policy, or any declared
 * policy's corroborating variable already standing at its declared value — then
 * the run must match one declared policy *completely* or it is
 * `unauthorized_automation`. It does not fall back to "an ordinary shell", and
 * a terminal does not rescue it. The failure mode being closed off is the one
 * where an automation with a half-configured environment quietly acquires the
 * rights of whichever rung it happens to land on next.
 *
 * A PTY NEVER PROMOTES AN AGENT. Agents attach terminals; the interactive check
 * runs strictly after the agent check, so no arrangement of streams turns a
 * recognized agent into a person.
 *
 * CI POLICY IS CONFIGURED. Athena's classifier hardcoded one workflow, one
 * job, one event name and one policy id. Every one of those is config data
 * here, and the returned CI context carries the matched policy's own values, so
 * a caller reads what authorized this run rather than what this module was
 * written believing. Supported coding-host signals form a non-configurable
 * denial floor for interactive human classification.

/**
 * The submission flow: spec §8.3, from a manifest on disk to published records.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR. The validator answers "is this manifest internally
 * coherent, and does it agree with the candidate observation I was handed".
 * That is a judgement about a value. Submission is a judgement about the
 * *world*: the candidate as it is right now, the run root this harness
 * allocated, the bytes actually sitting in it, and a store that may already
 * hold a record under this identity. Those five SUB rules exist because the
 * transport is part of the trust model — a provider that could choose its own
 * run root, or submit against a candidate it prepared an hour ago, would make
 * every downstream guarantee decorative.
 *
 * THE ORDER, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER.
 *
 *   1. Read the manifest through the fs port.
 *   2. When a provider caller supplies its allocated attempt, bind that one
 *      snapshot to the expected provider, run, and run root.
 *   3. Re-capture the candidate through the injected port (SUB-1, SUB-2).
 *   4. Require a current preparation receipt for that candidate — the
 *      preparation receipt's ordering mechanism.
 *   5. Derive the run root from the provider coordinates, and observe every
 *      declared artifact inside it (ENV-10's realpath clause, ENV-11).
 *   6. Validate the manifest, handing it the re-captured candidate and the
 *      artifact bytes read in step 5.
 *   7. Aggregate: the validator's rejections and this module's, in one
 *      response (SUB-5), with no record written if there is a single one
 *      (GEN-3).
 *   8. Publish one record per claim, stamped with the manifest digest (SUB-4).
 *
 * Capture precedes the receipt check because the receipt is evaluated *against*
 * a candidate: there is nothing to compare a receipt to until something has
 * been observed. The receipt check precedes everything else because a stale
 * receipt means the wiring or the tree that produced this candidate is not the
 * one in front of us, and validating a manifest against it would answer a
 * question nobody asked.
 *
 * NO RECEIPT IS A BLOCKER, NEVER A BYPASS. A missing, invalid, wiring-mismatched
 * or stale receipt ends the submission with the receipt's own typed blockers.
 * There is deliberately no option to skip the check and no code path that
 * substitutes the captured candidate for a receipt: the ordering is a mechanism
 * precisely because there is nothing else to consult.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DECIDED HERE. Whether an obligation is *satisfied* — that is the
 * gate's question, asked later against the records this writes. This module
 * accepts or rejects a submission; it never resolves an obligation, and it
 * never reads a clock. Freshness in this system is content identity (GEN-5),
 * and `recordedAt` is data whose grammar the validator checks and whose value
 * nothing consults.

/**
 * The admission adapter: the effectful seam between the store, the classified
 * execution context, the caller-supplied live results, and the *pure* gate
 * evaluator.
 *
 * WHAT LIVES HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE EVALUATOR. `evaluateGate` is a total
 * function of values — it opens no file, runs no git, and reads no clock. That
 * is what lets it be exercised as a decision table. But something has to turn a
 * repository into those values: capture the candidate, resolve the git-private
 * store, read the records filed under each obligation, map the store's
 * quarantine into the evaluator's diagnostic union, and translate the classified
 * context. That is this module, and the purity sensor's d2 rule holds it to the
 * bargain — every filesystem effect it performs is routed through `records.ts`
 * or `preparation.ts` (each of which owns its own fs), never a direct `node:fs`.
 *
 * THE ORDER, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER.
 *
 *   1. Capture the candidate through the injected port. Everything downstream is
 *      about *this* candidate, so there is nothing to do until one is observed.
 *   2. Prove capture and store name the same workspace. The adapter both
 *      assembles the candidate binding and synthesizes waiver records filed
 *      under the store's workspace id; if those two workspaces disagreed, a
 *      waiver would be filed where the candidate does not live and still pass
 *      the freshness comparison, which is exactly the silent hazard the recorder
 *      flagged for "the CLI". This is the place that can see both, so this is the
 *      place that asserts it.
 *   3. Require a current preparation receipt. No receipt is a blocker, never a
 *      bypass — and it is decided before the gate runs, so a missing receipt can
 *      never reach a waiver prompt.
 *   4. Project activation, read the store, evaluate.
 *   5. Two-pass waiver, only if the first pass blocked on nothing but waivable
 *      findings and the run is an interactive human with a prompt wired.
 *
 * appliesToCandidate IS DECIDED HERE. The evaluator judges freshness, but it is
 * the adapter that decides which discovered records are even *about* this
 * candidate. A well-formed record whose binding is not fresh for the candidate
 * under evaluation is excluded — it resolves as absent, not as stale evidence,
 * because a record for another candidate is not this candidate's stale evidence,
 * it is simply not its evidence. A quarantined file is the opposite case: its
 * binding cannot be parsed, so it cannot be shown to belong to another
 * candidate, and the fail-closed reading is that it applies (a store that cannot
 * account for its own contents is a gate decision).
 *
 * THE TWO-PASS WAIVER EVALUATION. A blocked first pass whose every finding an
 * interactive human may waive earns exactly one prompt, naming every obligation
 * that one "yes" covers. On acceptance the candidate is re-captured — a change
 * while the prompt was open voids the offer — and then candidate-bound waiver
 * records are written to disk and the gate is evaluated a second time, with
 * those record ids handed in as this invocation's grants. The write happens only
 * after an accepted prompt and a clean re-capture, so a decline or a drift
 * leaves the store exactly as it found it: zero waiver records.
 *
 * WHAT THE PORT FROM ATHENA DROPPED. Athena's admission wrote gate-decision
 * telemetry events, spawned private validation providers inside admission, and
 * mapped two Athena-only providers (documentation and delivery-run telemetry).
 * None of those is in this adapter's scope: admission itself never spawns, there
 * is no decision-event stream, and the neutral CLI rail invokes only opt-in
 * provider commands before handing their ordinary evidence/live results back
 * here. And Athena's
 * `toEvaluatorContext` remapped the classifier's kinds onto the evaluator's;
 * here `context.ts` already emits the evaluator's `ExecutionContext` union, so
 * the translation is the identity and the classified context is consumed
 * directly. Athena's `invocation:`-prefixed waiver ids are likewise gone: a
 * content-addressed id cannot carry a prefix, so this invocation's grants are
 * named explicitly through `invocationWaiverRecordIds` instead.

 * here rather than in the emitting command so that every appender — today's
 * `emit`, tomorrow's — is held to it at the store boundary.
 *

 * case: one run, one ticket for the thing being dogfooded and one for the
 * ordinary item it delivered, each with its own posture. So `posture.declared`,

 * shape `ticket.read` uses, naming which of the run's tickets the entry belongs
 * to. The member is optional rather than required because binding by adjacency
 * is what every single-ticket journal already does and those journals stay
 * readable: an entry that omits it binds to the run's PRIMARY ticket, which
 * `runPrimaryTicket` below defines. Nothing requires the member — the
 * completeness evaluator does not name it — so adding it opens no journal that

 * (docs/plans/2026-08-29-001-feat-managed-agent-delivery-system-plan.md in
 * the Athena repository, the contract-freeze authority).
 *
 * Three frozen surfaces live here and nowhere else:
 *
 *   1. The intake and delivery state discriminator lists, plus the
 *      host-activity marker list. `failed` is frozen as a terminal delivery
 *      discriminator even though no enumerated transition ever enters it —
 *      an unreachable discriminator is fail-safe, and inventing an entry
 *      condition would be a spine revision requiring contract-freeze owner
 *      approval, so none is invented.
 *   2. The closed durable event-kind vocabulary, keyed by (journal, kind)
 *      PAIRS — never by a kind→journal map, because
 *      `operator.confirmation.recorded` legitimately homes in two journals
 *      (intake for contract confirmations, delivery for takeover
 *      authorizations) and a single-home map would wrongly reject one of
 *      them. Active kinds have their payloads frozen in `journal.ts`;
 *      reserved kinds reject unconditionally — with or without a payload —
 *      until their owning unit defines them; a pair outside the enumeration
 *      rejects as unknown.
 *   3. The three-kind observation-only exemption: `activity.observed`,
 *      `trust.epoch.observed`, and `control.plane.mirror.recorded` never
 *      advance the expected journal revision that fences, assertions, and
 *      confirmations bind. The mirror kind is simultaneously reserved: the
 *      exemption records where it will sit once its owning unit defines it,
 *      and until then the reserved rejection wins.
 *
 * Adding any kind, state, or journal — active or reserved — is a spine
 * contract revision requiring contract-freeze owner approval. The vocabulary
 * tests assert these lists element by element to make a silent edit
 * impossible.

 * The runner hands a port a host-neutral scenario ("a stale-fence

 * calls that, and returns a normalized outcome. Nothing in this module knows
 * about settings files, hooks, sandboxes, worktrees, or approval protocols.
 *

 *
 *   - DENIAL IS THE DEFAULT. Every negative case asserts a denial, so a host
 *     that fails open on any of them is caught here rather than in production.
 *   - THE RESUME POSITION IS DERIVED, NOT DECLARED. A host reports its graded

 *
 * THREE CLASSES, three binding profiles:
 *
 *   - `delivery-bound` (waiver validity/confirmation and the policy-required
 *     merge/deploy approvals): binds origin, delivery, candidate, policy,

 *     binds the target installation and generation identities in place of
 *     delivery/candidate/fence; the high-water-mark advance binds the target
 *     mark instead of a generation. Only the product-trust revocation epoch
 *     exists in this lane — there is no delivery, so the repository authority
 *     epoch is recorded explicitly absent-by-state.
 *   - `security-blocked-migration`: binds the target installation and
 *     generation identities (the target generation being non-revoked is a
 *     consumption rule) plus the target delivery identity and its expected
 *     journal revision, in place of candidate/fence. The consuming site
 *     rejects on any mismatch; the mandatory full re-preparation recaptures
 *     candidate, fence, and policy, so none of those is bound here.
 *

 * rules — so the decision is the parameter and everything else is here. A
 * second copy of this body is a second place for a torn tail to be mishandled.
 *
 * ATOMIC CHECKPOINTS. A durable entry is a TERMINATED line: JSON followed by a
 * newline. An interrupted append leaves an unterminated tail whose caller
 * never saw success — it is not a checkpoint, so reads reduce the terminated
 * prefix and the next append truncates the torn tail before extending.
 *
 * OPEN DISCIPLINE COMES FROM THE CALLER. The spine store keeps the plain
 * append flag it has always used. The run store's files live under a directory
 * anything the owner executes can reach, so it passes `O_NOFOLLOW` and an
 * `fstat` check on the opened descriptor — ownership, mode, and regular-file —
 * rather than a separate lookup that a racing writer could invalidate.
